# Welcome to Tillies NFT Marketplace!

The platform that is Gas Free and built on the Flow blockchain. 

People are able to create, buy, and sell NFT's just like any other marketplace out there. What sets us apart is our 
ability to engage with each other on the nft iteself by adding comments. Not only will this increase the value of the nft, 
but users who aren't as familiar with the nft space can seek out advice and knowledge from other users!

# How to use the app

Go to this link here -> [https://brianross93.github.io/tilliesnftmarketplace/]

Once you've made it to the platform:
1. Log in with Blocto, itll have you enter an email and send you a code.
2. Once you're logged in, click the setup user in the dropdown menu. A modal will popup and you will need to hit approve(it takes a second for the modal to pop up please be patient).
3. Once that's complete you can start minting nfts!
4. click the list an nft and fill out the respective form.
5. When you hit mint you will need to approve that modal popup again and voila! you've minted your first nft!
6. when you go to the search page and enter the account address shown in the navbar, you'll be able to see the nft you minted.
